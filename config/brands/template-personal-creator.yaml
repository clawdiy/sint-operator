# Brand 4: Creator / Personal Brand

name: "[Your Name]"
voice:
  tone:
    - authentic
    - opinionated
    - energetic
    - self-aware
  style: "First person. Your experience is your content. Share what you learned, what you got wrong, what surprised you. Be specific — names, numbers, dates. Hot takes are fine if you can defend them. Vulnerability wins, but never performative vulnerability."
  doNot:
    - Use 'content creator' to describe yourself
    - Start threads with 'Thread 🧵'
    - Ask for engagement ('Like if you agree')
    - Post motivational quotes without original commentary
    - Use the word 'grind' or 'hustle' positively
    - Humble-brag ('So humbled to announce...')
  vocabulary:
    - built (not created)
    - learned (not discovered)
    - failed (not pivoted, when you actually failed)
    - made (not generated or produced)
    - real talk (not to be honest)
  examples:
    - "I spent $40K on ads last year. $32K was wasted. Here's how I figured out which $8K worked."
    - "Everyone says 'build in public.' Nobody talks about the public part where you're embarrassed."
    - "Unpopular opinion: you don't need a personal brand. You need to be good at something and tell people about it."
