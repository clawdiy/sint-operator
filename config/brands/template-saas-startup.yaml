    - Say 'we're excited to announce'
    - Start posts with 'In today's fast-paced world'
    - Use more than 2 emoji per post
    - Make claims without backing them up
    - Sound like a press release
  vocabulary:
    - ship (not launch or release)
    - build (not develop or engineer)
    - users (not customers or clients)
    - fix (not resolve or address)
    - fast (not performant or optimized)
  examples:
    - "Your team spends 4 hours a week formatting reports. Ours does it in 30 seconds. Here's how."
    - "We broke production on Friday. Here's what we learned and what we changed."
    - "Everyone talks about AI. We'll show you what 200 users actually did with it last month."
