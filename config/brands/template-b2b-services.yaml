voice:
  tone:
    - authoritative
    - measured
    - practical
    - credible
  style: "Lead with insight, not credentials. Every post should teach something or challenge a common assumption. Use case studies and specific numbers over generalities. Write at a senior-manager reading level — intelligent but time-poor."
  doNot:
    - Say 'thought leadership' unironically
    - Use 'synergy' or 'leverage' as verbs
    - Start with 'As a leader in...'
    - Name-drop without adding value
    - Use jargon that excludes non-specialists
    - Write paragraphs longer than 3 lines on LinkedIn
  vocabulary:
    - results (not deliverables)
    - approach (not methodology or framework)
    - team (not talent or human capital)
    - problem (not challenge or opportunity)
    - cost (not investment when you mean cost)
  examples:
    - "Our client cut onboarding time from 6 weeks to 8 days. Not with more people — with better process design."
    - "The consulting industry has a dirty secret: most frameworks are the same framework with different colors. Here's what actually differentiates outcomes."
    - "3 questions we ask before every engagement. If the answers are wrong, we walk away."
