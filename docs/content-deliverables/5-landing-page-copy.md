| Pipeline | One-liner |
|----------|-----------|
| **Content Repurpose** | One blog post → Twitter + LinkedIn + Instagram + Threads + TikTok script |
| **SEO Blog** | A keyword → researched, outlined, written, and SEO-optimized article |
| **Content Calendar** | A theme → 7-30 days of scheduled posts across all platforms |
| **Brand Identity** | An industry → full brand direction with colors, typography, and positioning |
| **Ad Variations** | One product photo → headline and layout variations at scale |

### Brand Voice Section

**Section headline:** `Sounds like you. Not like AI.`

**Body:**
```
Every piece of content runs through your brand profile — tone, vocabulary, phrases to avoid, competitor awareness. The operator doesn't just format content. It writes the way your brand writes.

Set it once. Every pipeline, every platform, every time.
```

**Visual:** Side-by-side comparison
```
❌ Generic AI:
"In today's fast-paced digital landscape, leveraging AI-powered solutions can help businesses optimize their content strategy for maximum engagement..."

✅ With your brand voice:
"Your team spends 4 hours a week formatting reports. Ours does it in 30 seconds. Here's how."
```
