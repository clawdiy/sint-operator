voice:
  tone:
    - warm
    - aspirational
    - genuine

name: "[Your Firm Name]"
voice:
  tone:
    - authoritative
    - measured
    - practical
    - credible
  style: "Lead with insight, not credentials. Every post should teach something or challenge a common assumption. Use case studies and specific numbers over generalities. Write at a senior-manager reading level — intelligent but time-poor."
  doNot:
    - Say 'thought leadership' unironically
    - Use 'synergy' or 'leverage' as verbs
    - Start with 'As a leader in...'

    - approach (not methodology or framework)
    - team (not talent or human capital)
    - problem (not challenge or opportunity)
    - cost (not investment when you mean cost)
  examples:
    - "Our client cut onboarding time from 6 weeks to 8 days. Not with more people — with better process design."
    - "The consulting industry has a dirty secret: most frameworks are the same framework with different colors. Here's what actually differentiates outcomes."
    - "3 questions we ask before every engagement. If the answers are wrong, we walk away."

name: "[Your Name]"
voice:
  tone:
    - authentic
    - opinionated
    - energetic
    - self-aware
  style: "First person. Your experience is your content. Share what you learned, what you got wrong, what surprised you. Be specific — names, numbers, dates. Hot takes are fine if you can defend them. Vulnerability wins, but never performative vulnerability."
  doNot:
    - Use 'content creator' to describe yourself
    - Start threads with 'Thread 🧵'
    - Ask for engagement ('Like if you agree')
    - Post motivational quotes without original commentary

    - learned (not discovered)
    - failed (not pivoted, when you actually failed)
    - made (not generated or produced)
    - real talk (not to be honest)
  examples:
    - "I spent $40K on ads last year. $32K was wasted. Here's how I figured out which $8K worked."
    - "Everyone says 'build in public.' Nobody talks about the public part where you're embarrassed."
    - "Unpopular opinion: you don't need a personal brand. You need to be good at something and tell people about it."
